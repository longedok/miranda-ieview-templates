To install the template, place all these files to %miranda_installation_folder%\Skins\IEView\nizer_themes and choose myskin.ivt in IEView settings (settings -> message sessions -> ieview -> message log -> Use Templates).
Mind that you should name p@point.im contact as "point", juick@juick.com as "juick" and bnw@bnw.im as "bnw" in order to be able to use according microblogging sercives. I know it's a bad thing that users have to rename their contacts, but unfortunatelly there's no way to get contact's jid (which would've been much more convinient) from inside of ieview.
